# Breast Tumor Segmentation and Classification from Ultrasound Scans

This project has 2 main goals: Segment breast tumors and predict if the tumor is benign or malignant from Ultrasound images.

The first task is a image segmentation task, in which my model will show where the tumors are in the ultrasound scans.

The second task is a binary classification task, in which my model will predict if the tumors are beign or cancerous. Benign tumors/masses are collections of abnormally grown cells. They usually have a define border and don't spread to other organs or cause any health problems. Benign masses in the breasts are common.

This project is important because breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the world. Early detection of breast cancer can significantly increase treatment efficacy and patient survival. One of the most common non invasive and inexpensive breast cancer detection methods is ultrasound. I hope that my deep learning models can be used as an aid for physicians in diagnosing breast cancer.

The data set I use for this project is the Kaggle dataset: Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset(BUSI). This data set include ultrasound scans of breast masses and their segmentation made by human experts. The scans are also identified as benign or malignant.

## Result

My model can perform tumor segmentation and classification with a good accuracy. Here are some sample outputs:
